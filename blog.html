                <p>Certainly! The scope of variables declared with var, let, and const differs, affecting their
                    accessibility and lifespan within the code. Let's discuss each:
    
                    1.var:
                    Variables declared with var are function-scoped or globally scoped, but not block-scoped.
                    This means that var variables are accessible throughout the function in which they are declared, even
                    outside of conditional blocks.
                    If declared outside of a function, var variables become global variables, accessible throughout the
                    script.
                    Redeclaring a var variable within the same scope doesn't generate an error; the variable's value is
                    simply overwritten.
                    <br><br>
                    2.let:
                    Variables declared with let are block-scoped.
                    They are accessible only within the block in which they are defined, including nested blocks.
                    Redeclaring a let variable within the same block generates an error.
                    let variables can be reassigned new values.
                    <br><br>
                    3.const:
                    Variables declared with const are block-scoped like let.
                    They must be initialized with a value when declared, and their value cannot be reassigned.
                    However, for objects and arrays, the value of const variables (the reference) cannot be changed, but the
                    properties or elements within them can be mutated.</p>

                <p> 1.null:The JavaScript primitive type null represents an intentional absence of a value. It's usually set
                    on
                    purpose to indicate that a variable has been declared but not yet assigned any value. null is different
                    from the similar primitive value undefined , which is an unintentional absence of any object value
                    <br><br>
                    2.undefined:A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement
                    also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A
                    function returns undefined if a value was not returned</p>

                What do you mean by REST API?

                    REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) is an API that follows the principles of REST. RESTful APIs are web services that use HTTP requests to perform various operations on resources (such as data or objects) identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).
                    
                    Here are the key principles of RESTful APIs: <br><br>
                    
                    1.Client-Server Architecture: RESTful APIs follow a client-server architecture, where the client and server are separate entities. The client sends requests to the server to perform operations on resources, and the server processes these requests and sends back responses.
                    <br><br>
                    2.Statelessness: RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning that each request from the client to the server must contain all the necessary information to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client state between requests.
                    <br><br>
                    3.Uniform Interface: RESTful APIs have a uniform interface that separates the concerns of the client and server. This interface typically includes the use of standard HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, along with the use of URIs to identify resources.
                    <br><br>
                    4.Resource-Based: RESTful APIs are resource-based, meaning that resources (such as data objects or files) are identified by URIs. Clients interact with these resources through standard HTTP methods.
                    <br><br>
                    5.Representation: Resources in RESTful APIs are represented in a format that can be easily consumed by clients, such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (eXtensible Markup Language). Clients can request different representations of resources using content negotiation.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, RESTful APIs provide a scalable, flexible, and standardized way for clients to interact with server-side resources over the web. They are widely used for building web services and are the backbone of many modern web applications and mobile apps.
